In order to recover our passphrase, we will need to perform a padding oracle attack utilizing Olivia as our
oracle. Because we are in AES-128, each block is 16 bytes meaning that we only have one block to target.
To start, we are going to alter our ciphertext's final byte and pass it into Olivia. If she returns True, we know that
decrypting the altered ciphertext ended with 01 which is valid padding. If she returns False, we know that our altered
ciphertext did not end with 01 and therefore did not have valid padding.
